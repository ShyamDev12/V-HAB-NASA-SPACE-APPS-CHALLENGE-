# V-HAB-NASA-SPACE-APPS-CHALLENGE-
Our Submission for NASA Space App Challenge 2021

We have developed a Mobile Application solution called V-HAB for "Near Space Near You!" problem statement using Unity as it a Cross platform. Our V-HAB  application will help student fraternity to learn and Develop a High Altitude balloon for exploring the Near Space in the Stratosphere region above the Sea-level. The application contains three modules in which the first one is the lesson plan which will elucidate on how to built a low cost high altitude balloon for space exploration. The Second Module will elaborate on Bill of Materials in a narrative way which will excite the students to know more about the components and its cost estimation. Followed by which the third module uses the latest Augmented Reality technology to bring up the real time experience of Flying the High Altitude balloons for the users. It provides an Interactive forum of learning as well as implementing it during the time of study. By this we can very well create an awareness about HABs and its applications in real time. Our application also opens the gate for researches and future studies in the domain of Astronomy.
